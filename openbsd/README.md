## MAKE A PATCH FOR A FILE ##

The sequence to make a patch for a file is usually:

- `cd $(make show=WRKSRC)`
- `cp foo/bar.c{,.orig.port}`
- Edit `foo/bar.c`
- `cd -`
- `make update-patches`

(This will create `patches/patch-foo_bar_c` with your modifications.)

The easiest way to reset the port and test your patches is `make clean
patch`. This will delete the work directory, re-extract, and patch
your port.
