.Nm swirc
.Bk -words
.Op Fl 46?CPRSXdipv
.Op Fl W Ar password

.Op Fl h Ar hostname
.Op Fl j Ar join
.Op Fl n Ar nickname

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a BSD licensed, console based and lightweight ICB and IRC client
written in C/C++, whose goals are to be portable and secure.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 addresses only
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 addresses only
.It Fl ?
Output help
.It Fl C
Do not change color definitions.
If the terminal used to run
.Nm
supports >= 256 colors and
.Xr can_change_color 3
is true
.Nm
uses
.Xr init_color 3
to initialize the extended IRC color palette.
Which may or may not already be set correctly by the terminal.
This option is useful in case the terminal look strange after exit,
which is possible to fix by simply restarting it.
.It Fl P
Permanently disable SASL authentication.
If specified, the effect is \fIfinal\fP (i.e. it overrides any config
file value.)
.It Fl R
Disable TLS/SSL peer verification
.It Fl S
Force TLS (Transport Layer Security)
.It Fl W Ar password
Equal effect as flag
.Fl p
but operates in a non-interactive manner.
Be careful if you are using this option on a public computer with
multiple other users because the password will then be visible to them
in the output of
.Xr ps 1 .
.It Fl X
Disable all IRCv3 extensions.
If you are connecting to an unmodern IRC server this flag is useful.
Because if the IRC server sees too many unknown commands during the
connection process it may result in a connection failure.
.It Fl c Ar server[:port]
Connect to given server.
If the port is omitted port 6667 will be chosen.
And if the port is 7326 ICB mode is turned on automatically.
Further, if the port is 6697
.Nm
attempts to initiate a TLS/SSL connection.
.It Fl d
Debug logging
.It Fl h Ar hostname
Controls the hostname which
.Nm
will attempt to make connection to the ICB/IRC server from.
Can happily be combined with
.Fl 4
and
.Fl 6 .
.It Fl i
Turn on Internet Citizen's Band mode
.It Fl j Ar join
A comma-separated list of channels to join.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
-j libera,linux,c,c++
.Ed
.It Fl n Ar nickname
Online nickname
.It Fl p
Server password (for private servers). However: InspIRCd has a module
called password forward, which means that if a server password is
specified by this flag, it will be used to identify to
.Em NickServ .
If so: connect with a TLS/SSL connection, i.e. an encrypted
connection, to prevent your password from being disclosed in clear
text.
.Nm
also supports IRCv3 SASL authentication which is probably a better
alternative.
.It Fl r Ar rl name
Your real name
.It Fl u Ar username
Your username

If many errors regarding
.Qo
In perform_convert_buffer: characters lost: Illegal byte sequence
.Qc
are present in the error log, then additional encodings for your
locale should be installed.
See
.Xr locale 1
for supported character encodings.
.Nm
can handle and are looking for:

Unfortunately some operating systems have decided to only support the
