 * arguments. In addition, the function and any called descendants
 * behave as follows:
 *
 *   1. Do not access for reading or writing any part of the program
 *   state visible in the caller at the point of the call.
 *
 *   2. Do not perform I/O.
 *
 *   3. Do not change any part of the program state not visible at the

 * If the function does have side effects, the results of executing a
 * program that calls this function are undefined. The compiler takes
 * advantage of this information at optimization level of 3 or above.
 *
 * Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the
 * data pointed to must not be declared const if the pointed-to data
 * might change between successive invocations of the function. In
 * general, since a function cannot distinguish data that might change
 * from data that cannot, const functions should never take pointer
 * or, in C++, reference arguments.
