  - `/ftp`
- **Changed** the program to squeeze text decoration in notification
  messages.
- **Fixed** option `notifications`.
  (Did not take effect on private messages).
- **Fixed** so that `/znc JumpNetwork` works. (It didn't until now due to

  progress

- `src/unix.mk`: provide a standard default target **all**
- io-loop: Get rid of zero-length printf format string warnings. (They
  weren't harmful in the first place.)

## [1.1] - 2016-08-27 ##
### Added ###
- Command
  - /banlist
  - /chanserv
  - /exlist
  - /ilist
  - /nickserv
- Additional data to the manual page
- Event
  - 324 (`RPL_CHANNELMODEIS`)
  - 329\. Undocumented. Channel date of creation.
  - 346-349 (numeric replies to /exlist and /ilist)
  - 367 (`RPL_BANLIST`)
  - 368 (`RPL_ENDOFBANLIST`)
  - 487\. Undocumented in the RFC. An error meaning that /msg target
    *ChanServ* or *NickServ* is no longer supported (in favor of
    **/chanserv** and **/nickserv**).
- On OpenBSD: restrict system operations by using pledge() if it's
  available.
- Window scrolling capabilities!

### Changed ###
- **/msg**: fail if recipient is *ChanServ* or *NickServ*. (Use of the
  commands **/chanserv** and **/nickserv** should be considered
  instead.)
- Interpreter: handle string truncation when copying an identifier or
  argument
- Look of the output produced by /list
- Only call `unget_wch(MY_KEY_RESIZE)` after sleeping for a requested
  interval. This possibly prevents the program from crashing or the
  terminal from being hung up due to a "resize attack".
- Printtext: replaced unbounded `sw_sprintf` calls with `sw_snprintf`
- `textbuffer_size_absolute` now defaults to 1500

### Fixed ###
- An issue
  - ...regarding the maintenance of channel statistics
  - ...where the cursor was left at the statusbar (after updating it)
- Visible usage of /list

### Added ###
- Support for multiple encodings:
  - UTF-8
  - ISO-8859-1
  - ISO-8859-15
- Command /list
- Event
  - 321-323 (numeric replies for /list)
  - 334\. Undocumented. At Undernet, it prints out usage describing
    parameters for the LIST command.
  - 341 (`RPL_INVITING`)
  - 412 (`ERR_NOTEXTTOSEND`)
  - 467 (`ERR_KEYSET`)
  - 471-474
  - 481 (`ERR_NOPRIVILEGES`)
  - 742 (MODE cannot be set due to channel having an active MLOCK
    restriction policy). ATM not documented in the RFC.

### Changed ###
- The default theme. Color codes that consisted of only one digit were
  changed to use two digits in some cases. For example: ^C3 changed to
  ^C03, ^C5 changed to ^C05, etc. Why? Consider a function call like
  printtext(..., "%s`one or more digits`", Theme(`primary_color`)). If
  the primary color, in this case, consists of only one digit and is
  directly followed by `one or more digits` the result is: one digit
  is lost and a random color will be displayed.

### Fixed ###
- As a fallback, instead of printing out "Printtext Internal Error",
  continue to convert characters even if some are lost due to an
  invalid multibyte sequence.
- Interpretation of color codes in the printtext module. For example:
  ^C123 didn't display '3' before as it should.
